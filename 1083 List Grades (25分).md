##  **1083** **List Grades** (25åˆ†)

Given a list of *N* student records with name, ID and grade. You are supposed to sort the records with respect to the grade in non-increasing order, and output those student records of which the grades are in a given interval.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case is given in the following format:

```
N
name[1] ID[1] grade[1]
name[2] ID[2] grade[2]
... ...
name[N] ID[N] grade[N]
grade1 grade2
```

where `name[i]` and `ID[i]` are strings of no more than 10 characters with no space, `grade[i]` is an integer in [0, 100], `grade1` and `grade2` are the boundaries of the grade's interval. It is guaranteed that all the grades are **distinct**.

### Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the student records of which the grades are in the given interval [`grade1`, `grade2`] and are in non-increasing order. Each student record occupies a line with the student's name and ID, separated by one space. If there is no student's grade in that interval, output `NONE` instead.

### Sample Input 1:

```in
4
Tom CS000001 59
Joe Math990112 89
Mike CS991301 100
Mary EE990830 95
60 100
```

### Sample Output 1:

```out
Mike CS991301
Mary EE990830
Joe Math990112
```

### Sample Input 2:

```in
2
Jean AA980920 60
Ann CS01 80
90 95
```

### Sample Output 2:

```out
NONE
```

### Code:

```c++
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

typedef struct {
    string name;
    string id;
    int score;
} Stu;

bool cmp(Stu s1, Stu s2) { return s1.score > s2.score; }

int main() {
    int n, g1, g2;
    cin >> n;
    Stu stu[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> stu[i].name >> stu[i].id >> stu[i].score;
    }
    sort(stu, stu + n, cmp);
    cin >> g1 >> g2;
    bool flag = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (stu[i].score >= g1 && stu[i].score <= g2) {
            flag = true;
            cout << stu[i].name << " " << stu[i].id << endl;
        }
    }
    if (!flag)
        cout << "NONE";
    return 0;
}
```
