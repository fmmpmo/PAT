##  **1061 Dating (20 åˆ†)** 

Sherlock Holmes received a note with some strange strings: `Let's date! 3485djDkxh4hhGE 2984akDfkkkkggEdsb s&hgsfdk d&Hyscvnm`. It took him only a minute to figure out that those strange strings are actually referring to the coded time `Thursday 14:04` -- since the first common capital English letter (case sensitive) shared by the first two strings is the 4th capital letter `D`, representing the 4th day in a week; the second common character is the 5th capital letter `E`, representing the 14th hour (hence the hours from 0 to 23 in a day are represented by the numbers from 0 to 9 and the capital letters from `A` to `N`, respectively); and the English letter shared by the last two strings is `s` at the 4th position, representing the 4th minute. Now given two pairs of strings, you are supposed to help Sherlock decode the dating time.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case gives 4 non-empty strings of no more than 60 characters without white space in 4 lines.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the decoded time in one line, in the format `DAY HH:MM`, where `DAY` is a 3-character abbreviation for the days in a week -- that is, `MON` for Monday, `TUE` for Tuesday, `WED` for Wednesday, `THU` for Thursday, `FRI` for Friday, `SAT` for Saturday, and `SUN` for Sunday. It is guaranteed that the result is unique for each case.

### Sample Input:

```in

2984akDfkkkkggEdsb 
s&hgsfdk 
d&Hyscvnm
```

### Sample Output:

```out
THU 14:04
```

### Code:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string s1, s2, s3, s4;
    cin >> s1 >> s2 >> s3 >> s4;
    string day[] = {"MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI", "SAT", "SUN"};
    int pos, i = 0;
    while (i < s1.length() && i < s2.length()) {
        if (s1[i] == s2[i] && s1[i] >= 'A' && s1[i] <= 'G') {
            cout << day[s1[i] - 'A'] << " ";
            break;
        }
        i++;
    }
    i++;
    while (i < s1.length() && i < s2.length()) {
        if (s1[i] == s2[i]) {
            if (s1[i] >= '0' && s1[i] <= '9') {
                printf("%02d:", s1[i] - '0');
                break;
            } else if (s1[i] >= 'A' && s1[i] <= 'N') {
                printf("%02d:", s1[i] - 'A' + 10);
                break;
            }
        }
        i++;
    }
    i = 0;
    while (i < s3.length() && i < s4.length()) {
        if (s3[i] == s4[i] && s3[i] >= 'A' && s3[i] <= 'z') {
            printf("%02d", i);
            break;
        }
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
